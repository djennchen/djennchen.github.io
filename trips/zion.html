														Zion is full of hikes that are different -- whether that's balancing across the a slender rock spur on Angel's Landing, finding and forging your own path across (and sometimes in) a stream in the Left Fork Canyon to find the Subway, or strolling along a paved river walkway, there is something for everyone.

														Paired with Bryce, the scenery you will see in these parks literally can likely be found no where else on earth. It is a stunning example of the sheer diversity of nature we can find in the USA and hope that we can preserve these amazing formations for the future.

										<h3 id="day1"> Day 1: Arrival </h3>
										<p>
											In January, I had floated the idea of Zion with Angel's Landing and Subway as two of our hikes. This did necessitate planning ahead of time -- both hikes require permits (Subway is technically a wilderness permit), but you do get the results early enough where you can use that help determine the logistics of your trip (or decide to go somewhere else if you don't win the lottery). We gambled on end of May to take advantage of Memorial Day as well balance the heat as well hoping the <a href="https://www.nps.gov/zion/planyourvisit/thenarrows.htm">Narrows</a> would be open (spoiler: it wasn't). In my miniscule sample size, the permits are not too hard to get and multiple members of our group of 4 scored first choices for the hikes. The most up to date permit information and dates can be found on the National Park Service website.
										</p>
										<p>T
											he best airport to fly into for Zion is Las Vegas (LAS), which has solid (and cheap) connections throughout the country. From there, it was a 2.5 hour drive to the <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/14028596">Airbnb </a>we were staying in in Hurricane, Utah. In theory, the closest town to stay in is Springdale, but lodging there is limited and pricey. We saved quite a bit staying in Hurricane, and our drive to the visitor center was only 30 or so minutes.
										</p>
										<p>On to the fun parts!</p>

										<h3 id="day2"> Day 2: Angel's Landing </h3>
										<figure class="image right">
											<img style="width: 32%" src="../images/travel/zion/zion_2.jpeg" alt="At the Grotto trailhead heading up the West Rim Trail"/>
											<img style="width: 18%" src="../images/travel/zion/zion_3.jpeg" alt="Along the West Rim Trail"/>
										</figure>
										<p>
											From Hurricane, we drove out 30 minutes to get to the Zion Canyon Visitor Center to pick up our Wilderness Permit for the Left Fork, which would allow us to hike Subway tomorrow. There was a bit of traffic getting into the park around 8 AM, but seemed mostly due to people needing to buy tickets than actual congestion. We had no issues parking and then picking up our permit (the ranger will ask you a few questions, so be prepared -- as you should for any hike -- to know what you are tackling with Subway). As foreshadowed, it was very high snowpack year for the Western US so river flow was higher than the previous years. It meant the Narrows was closed (it only opens once the Virgin River is below 150 CFS) and also meant it seemed pretty easy to get "day of" permits for Subway, since people had a concern about the flow/coldness of the river and the hike would not have the iconic green pools it is known for (spoiler: it was still very pretty awesome).
										</p>
										<p>
											Our permit time for Angel's Landing was 9 am - 12 pm at the Grotto bus stop, though they didn't actually check our permit until the base of Angel's Landing. We took the shuttle into the park (private vehicles aren't allowed during certain times) and despite the horror stories I read online, the shuttle was efficient and frequent. We started the hike at 9:45 AM and it definitely was already a bit warm (at least a higher temperature than I usually prefer my hikes to be at). 
										</p>

											<img style="width: 18%" src="../images/travel/zion/zion_5.jpeg" alt="Walter's wiggles"/>
										</figure>
										<p>
											The hike is a bit of a "choose your own adventure" and you can (and should) hike a bit further beyond the actual Angel's Landing spur to explore the less crowded sections. We clocked in at about <b>8.9 miles, 3,669 ft of elevation, and 4 hours</b>. Just doing Angel's Landing is about <a href="https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/utah/angels-landing-trail">4.3 miles, 1,827 ft</a>, but its possible to extend it to as much as 15.5 miles, 4,396 ft in this <a href="https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/utah/angels-landing-west-rim-telephone-loop">loop </a>. It's generally an uphill hike (except for one nice shaded canyon section) that's exposed, ft the infamous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angels_Landing">Walter's Wiggles</a>. You get better and better views of the canyon (and its beautiful reds and white walls) as you ascend.

										</figure>
										<p>
											At Scout's Lookout (base of Angel's Landing) is where they check permits. You do need to show some form of identification to ensure the permit holder is actually who they say they are. From there, we headed up. This is where you can see <b>why</b> a permit system is needed -- the hike itself I did not find dangerous per se (though I was plagued by the continuous fear of dropping my phone), but it does get narrow (one way) in sections with just a chain or your own footing to stop you from falling. If there was a horde of people backed up all in line, the hike gets much more scary.
										</p>

											<img style="width: 18%" src="../images/travel/zion/zion_10.jpeg" alt="Squirrel at the top of Angel's Landing (don't feed them!)"/>
										</figure>
										<p>
											There's a pretty good reason why Angel's Landing is consistently rated as one of the top hikes in the US. While I'm not sure it reached that top 3 tier for me (I'm partial to alpine/glacier hikes!), it was certainly memorable. You are literally thrust into the canyon as you hike along the spur. Honestly, it just kept going -- for some reason I thought the chain section was short, but it was a decent portion of the hike. At the top, there's a bit of a wider flat area that you can just rest and enjoy.
										</p>

											<img style="width: 32%" src="../images/travel/zion/zion_13.jpeg" alt="West Rim Trail"/>
										</figure>
										<p>
											As mentioned, we trekked a bit further past Angel's Landing. It got a ton quieter, which I appreciated. But we were the full mid day sun definitely made it hot as well. The views were different than those of the main canyon, with much more whites than reds (I'm sure a geologist would have much more interesting things to say here). Even if its just for a bit like us, I would highly recommend venturing out beyond the cut off to Angel's Landing!
										</p>
										<p>
											After heading down, we caught the shuttle back to the visitor center and our car. Our last errand for the day was to rent the gear we needed for Subway the next day. Like the Narrows, the Subway is a trek in the river (not as high) so there are different options that can be rented (boots, boots + pants, full bib, etc) depending on the season and water level. We walked into <a href="https://www.zionadventures.com/rent-narrows-equipment.html">Zion Adventures</a> and picked up some canyoneering boots and a stick :)
										</p>
										<h3 id="day3"> Day 3: Subway </h3>

										<figure class="image left">
											<img style="width: 32%" src="../images/travel/zion/zion_14.jpeg" alt="View from Angel's Landing"/>
										</figure>
										<p>
											Here was another hike I was continuously afraid of dropping my phone! The path to the <a href="https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/utah/the-subway-trail">Subway</a>, through the Left Fork Bottom Up route (top down is a canyoneering route), is technically not a marked trail which is why the permit type is a "wilderness" one. You quite literally, choose your own path. That being said, this is a pretty tame path finding experience since after the initial climb down into the canyon you just follow (or just walk in) the river until you hit the unmistakable Subway. It is still a good idea to have an offline map (e.g. Alltrails, Gaia, Google). The <a href="https://modernhiker.com/hike/the-subway-from-the-bottom-up">Modern Hiker</a> provides a pretty good guide to the route.
										</p>
										<figure class="image right">
											<img style="width: 32%" src="../images/travel/zion/zion_15.jpeg" alt="View from Angel's Landing"/>
										</figure>
										<p>
											It was a 30 minute drive to the Left Fork Trailhead. Depending on how efficient your path is, this hike can be as quick as few hours or as long as a full day. Definitely budget a full day for this one though. Starting around 9 AM, we ended up with about <b>9.5 miles, 1,351 ft of elevation, and a 5.5 hours</b> to complete the hike. One warning we got a few times was the easiest place to get lost is being unable to find the path up the canyon when returning from the Subway. There's a small sign indicating the turnoff/trailhead, but the ranger advised to us to take photos and drop a GPS pin as well. After descending from the trailhead through the rocky canyon, all you have to do is follow the river upstream!
